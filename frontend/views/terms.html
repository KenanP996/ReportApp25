        ReportApp25 is an academic project showcasing a full-stack architecture that combines a FlightPHP REST backend
        with a JavaScript single-page application. These terms describe how the platform will be used once the backend is
        implemented in later milestones.

        <li>Authorized users must hold a verified organization email address.</li>
        <li>Users agree to maintain accuracy of company reports and pickup records.</li>
        <li>Team Leads may grant and revoke membership based on operational needs.</li>

        The application is still under active development. By accessing the current static prototype you acknowledge that
        no real data is transmitted until the FlightPHP backend and MySQL database are provisioned in future milestones.
