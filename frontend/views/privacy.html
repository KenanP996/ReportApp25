        ReportApp25 stores organization data necessary to coordinate electronics donation pickups, manage team
        membership, and track compliance. During upcoming milestones the backend will expose REST endpoints secured by
        JWT and role-based access controls.

      <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Data We Plan to Collect</h3>
      <ul class="text-muted">
        <li>Account details (name, email, hashed passwords, role assignments).</li>
        <li>Pickup logistics (locations, time windows, confirmed items).</li>
        <li>Team membership and application history.</li>
        <li>Activity logs for auditing and issue resolution.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-muted">
        The backend will rely on MySQL with PDO prepared statements. FlightPHP middleware will enforce JWT verification
        and scoped access to protect personally identifiable information. For Milestone 1 only static data is stored in
        the browser.
